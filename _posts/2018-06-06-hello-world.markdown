First!

Ok, I've decided it's time that I actually have a website with somewhere to post about the things that interest me. I'll be using this space to post links to, or summaries of, things I find that interest me, as well as original notes and articles.

The content here will probably be a mix of things.
* Sysadmin: Windows, Powershell, web, security, and privacy.
* Craft: Woodworking, Furniture Making 
* Automotive: Car/Truck/Motorcycle projects, Builds and Parts lists, Trip Reports, even Automotive Electrical Wiring
